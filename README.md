This repository contains my Lab 6 - Docker and Containers solution for the Introduction to DevOps module in the third year of the Computer Science course at TU Dublin.

# Overview

This lab explores Docker and containerization by building a Docker image for a Flask web application, running it in a container, and inspecting an existing production-grade Dockerfile. The goal is to understand how Dockerfiles work, manage containers, and analyze image layers.

# Key Tasks

- Created a `Dockerfile` to containerize a Flask app.
- Built and ran the Docker container, mapping ports for accessibility.
- Verified container operation and tested the web application.
- Inspected an existing `python:3.13` image to analyze its layers and dependencies.
- Examined why Python is built from source in the Dockerfile and identified `make` invocations.

This lab provided hands-on experience with Docker, demonstrating containerization, deployment, and image inspection techniques essential for DevOps and modern application development.
